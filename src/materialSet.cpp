-							       MAYA OGRE EXPORTER                                       -
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Description: 	This is a plugin for Maya, that allows the export of animated               -
-              	meshes in the OGRE file format. All meshes will be combined                 -
-              	together to form a single OGRE mesh, each Maya mesh will be                 -
-              	translated as a submesh. Multiple materials per mesh are allowed            -
-              	each group of triangles sharing the same material will become               -
-              	a separate submesh. Skeletal animation and blendshapes are                  -
-              	supported, or, alternatively, vertex animation as a sequence                -
-              	of morph targets.                                                           -
-              	The export command can be run via script too, for instructions              -
-              	on its usage please refer to the Instructions.txt file.  					-
- Note: 		The particles exporter is an extra module submitted by the OGRE         	-
- 				community, it still has to be reviewed and fixed.  		            		-
